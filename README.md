# ChargePlan
Optimizes the charging of electrical car under an ecological (not financial) point of view. Currently supports
the wallbox "goEcharger" and measurement data from Swissmeteo, but is made to be expanded with more "drivers".

First priority: charge only during solar energy production
Second priority: charge immediately to ensure car is full

Future:
- grid load dependency (charge when grid is under light load)
- new modules for measurement
